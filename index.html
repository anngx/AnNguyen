         <h1>A Bit About Me:</h1>
  <h2>I am currently a 4th year Studio Arts and Digital Narrative & Interactive Design student. This semester, I’m taking 6 courses total including Creative Coding and Painting 3. For my painting project series, I am creating a body of work centered around queerness and the notion of radical self-love. 
    <br>When I first entered university, I was set on pursuing Computational Biology. Although I passed all of my examinations that first semester, I was completely miserable and felt no passion for my studies. During my second semester at Pitt, I took 1 drawing course and immediately fell in love, with everything from the course work to the intimate class sizes. However, I soon realized that exclusively pursuing Studio Arts is impractical and frankly not worth it considering Pitt’s tuition. I looked into lucrative creative career options and began independently studying UX Design. I was a junior when Pitt came out with their DNID major, for which I discovered I already had a decent amount of credits from previously taking CS courses, so I went for it.
